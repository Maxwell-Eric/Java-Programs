## This project is associated with Princeton's Algorithms Part I class from coursera.
## It creates a kdTree with points, which are shown on a graph. When a point is added to the kdTree data structure, a verticle blue or horizontal red line is created through the point on the graph. The colored line will stop at the point which is the parent in the binary tree.
