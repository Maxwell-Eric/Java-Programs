## This project is associated with Princeton's Algorithms Part I class from coursera.
## It creates a kdTree data structure with points, which are shown on a graph. When a point is added to the kdTree data structure, a verticle blue or horizontal red line is created through the point on the graph. The colored line will stop at the line which contains the parent point, or any point higher in the binary tree (both of which will be the other color of the line containing the new point. The root node's line will extend across the entire window.

There are two programs contained in this project.
  - The first program opens a blank window. The user clicks on the window to add a point to that spot. The graph will add blue or red line depending on where in the tree the point is added. The point's location in the balanced binary tree can be determined by where the line starts and stops.
