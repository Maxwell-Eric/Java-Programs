## This project is associated with Princetons Algorithms Part I from coursera.
- This project creates a square system which can percolate.
- Sites can be opened and connected to adjacent open sites with a union find data structure.
- The system percolates when there is a path from the top of the system to the bottom.


### There are two executable programs in this project. 
  - The first program displays a system selected from a list of text files. Sites are removed based on the input file selected. The system shows sites connected to the top layer in blue. If there is a path from the top to the bottom, the system 'percolates'.

  - The second project calculates the statistics of the number of sites needed to be removed to cause a system to percolate. The user inputs the number of sites on each side and the number of trials. The mean percentage of sites needed to be removed to cause a system to percolate is calculated. The standard deviation and the confidence interval are also calculated and included. There is a jar file for this program call Percolation_Stats.jar.
