## Model Rocket Performance Estimator for High School Physics
This program is designed to use with a highschool physics class studing Newton's Laws of Motion and the kinematic equations. A model rocket is launched with an altimiter. The program takes into account change in mass and velocity to calculate instant acceleration using the equation acceleration = Net Force/mass. The drag force changes with the square of the velocity. Time in incremented and performance parameters are updated for every 0.01 seconds. An altimiter is placed in the rocket and the results are compared to the graph produced. The User manual shows the GUI and an example of a graph produced.
